# Friend Quiz
### By Tommeeboi
This was inspired by my friend, who used something similar to this for me :D (and his other friends)

This isn't very serious or high effort, just a fun little website I made in literally 2 hours

## How To Run
If you want to use this for yourself (for some reason), do this:

1. Download this repository (click Code, then Download ZIP)
2. Unzip/extract it
3. Inside the unzipped copy, open index.html (in your browser)

Unfortunately, the site won't function properly on mobile by downloading it.

## FAQ
Q. The site has a white background, an ugly font, and it doesn't work properly!

A. Make sure you've unzipped the website folder, and that you're viewing it inside of the unzipped version. Also, this will always happen on mobile, that's why I said it doesn't function properly.

Q. Can I add custom values?

A. Not yet. Maybe in the future though ;)

And with that I've probably made enough people puke because of my bad css already.

## Releases
v1.0: Initial Release

v1.0.1: Changed LICENSE.txt to LICENSE and updated README.md
